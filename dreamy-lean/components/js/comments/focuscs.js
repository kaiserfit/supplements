       "content": "I’ve enjoyed using Queen Focus over the last few weeks. For myself it did take roughly a week of taking the product before I felt much of a difference. However after a week of continuous use I began to feel an increase in my multitasking abilities and also an increase of the fluidity in the use of verbal and written English. This is a definite improvement to my standard baseline, and since noticing these effects they have continued to steadily increase. Thanks for creating a quality product.",
