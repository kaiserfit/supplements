         "content": "After bouts of food poisoning and courses of anti biotics over years my gut health was terrible. Had regular acid reflux, bloating, IBS, and general indigestion for a very long time. I was sceptical of this product and read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try. After about 2 days I noticed a definite improvement. Literally all my symptoms disappeared after about 3-4 days. I have a bit more energy and a general better mood. I was surprised that it worked. I'm hoping that these probiotics do permanently repair my gut health, and the results are really promising.",

Nothing prescribed by my GP helped, I was referred to a gastroenterologist who couldn't find anything wrong but suggested avoiding gluten which helped my symptoms initially. However over time I found more and more foods would bring on my symptoms and was suffering almost every day. A nutritionist advised me to go on the FODMAP diet which I didn't feel made much difference and I was constantly bloated. The nutritionist did mention probiotics help in some people which is why I thought I would give these a try after reading the reviews. I am SO GLAD I did as within 1 day my symptoms had almost completely disappeared, I have been able to eat anything even wheat and dairy which I previously thought I was intolerant to without any symptoms of pain and bloating, no gut spasms everything moves along nicely. I spent years suffering and avoiding so many foods as was told to by doctors, no one ever said I could have an imbalance of gut bacteria causing symptoms. I'm so pleased to have found these I am now able to go out for meals without worrying about symptoms, my energy levels and mood has also improved massively. I would highly recommend giving them a try if you’re still on the fence.",

Also, my IBS episodes have reduced. Headaches were fewer and my gut was no longer bloated. The tablets are easy to swallow and have no discernible taste. I am now a regular consumer of this medication.",

       "content": "I’ve enjoyed using Queen Focus over the last few weeks. For myself it did take roughly a week of taking the product before I felt much of a difference. However after a week of continuous use I began to feel an increase in my multitasking abilities and also an increase of the fluidity in the use of verbal and written English. This is a definite improvement to my standard baseline, and since noticing these effects they have continued to steadily increase. Thanks for creating a quality product.",
